## Hi Spring Petclinic Lovers ðŸ‘‹

This [Spring Petclinic organisation](https://spring-petclinic.github.io) on GitHub offers **variants** of the official [Spring Petclinic](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-petclinic) demo project, illustrating various aspects of Spring technologies. You'll find **classic implementations** using **Spring Boot** as well as **modern architectures**, such as **microservices** via **Spring Cloud**.
Versions using **Angular** and **React** for the front end are also available, showing the integration of Spring with contemporary JavaScript frameworks. These projects serve as references for implementing best practices with Spring and architecting scalable applications. They are particularly useful for **Java**, **Kotlin** and **frontend developers** wishing to explore robust and modern solutions.
